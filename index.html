					<p>Hello there! My name is Shugmi Shumunov and I am an aspiring developer who is learning how to code through the Front-End Development Bootcamp at Grand Circus.
					Welcome to my very first website!</p>
					<p>While at my previous job, I was inspired by a coworker to pursue programming. I was interested in learning to code for some time, but I never really pursued it.
					He showed me the endless possibilities and applications that learning how to program could have. Ultimately, I decided to learn how to code because I believe it
					has the potential to make the largest impact on the world and its inhabitants.</p>
					<p>In the same sense, this is why VR fascinates me. I believe that it will have tremendous impact on our lives in the next few years. One of the coolest
					<a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/6/2/11837608/elon-musk-simulation-argument" target="_blank">talks</a> I've listened to about VR was Elon Musk discussing how we may already
					be inside an advanced simulation. Absolutely crazy stuff!</p>
