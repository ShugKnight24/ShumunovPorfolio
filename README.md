# ShumunovPorfolio

*Update:* Minor changes made on 8/17/2017. I was refactoring old code while streaming on Twitch. Changes to file names, making indentation more consistent, minor style changes, and adding `'use strict';` to my script file.

I may potentially revisit in the future to remove floats and move to a responsive design.

Hello, my name is Shugmi Shumunov. I am an aspiring programmer who is enrolled in the Grand Circus Bootcamp in Detroit, Michigan to learn how to become a front-end developer.
Feel free to take a look at my first website and give me any applicable feedback. I would tremendously appreciate it.
Thank you!
