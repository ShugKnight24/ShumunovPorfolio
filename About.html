					<h3>Quotes That I Live By</h3>
						<p> The following quotes are ones that I find extremely inspirational. To me, they represent the mentality that one must approach 
						life with.</p>
					<p>
						From <cite>Meditations</cite> by Marcus Aurelius
						<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations">
							<p>In the morning when thou risest unwillingly, let this thought be present - I am rising to the work of a human being. Why then am I 
							dissatisfied if I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which I was brought into the world? Or have I been made for this,	
							to lie in the bed-clothes and keep myself warm? - But this is more pleasant. - Dost thou exist then to take thy pleasure, and not at all 
							for action or exertion? Dost thou not see the little plants, the little birds, the ants, the spiders, the bees working together to put 
							in order their several parts of the universe? And art thou unwilling to do the work of a human being, and dost thou not make haste to 
							do that which is according to thy nature? - But it is necessary to take rest also. - It is necessary: however nature has fixed bounds to 
							this too: she has fixed bounds both to eating and drinking, and yet thou goest beyond these bounds, beyond what is sufficient; yet 
							in thy acts it is not so, but thou stoppest short of what thou canst do </p>
						</blockquote>
						
						<p>
							<q>Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now, take what's left and live it properly. What doesn't transmit light creates 
							its own darkness.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							<q>Choose not to be harmed - and you won't feel harmed. Don't feel harmed - and you haven't been.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							<q>If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe 
							even your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean 
							derision. It could mean mockery--isolation. Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want 
							to do it. And, you'll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you're going 
							to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will 
							ride life straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is.</q> - Charles Bukowski
